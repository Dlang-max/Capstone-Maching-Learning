# Capstone-Maching-Learning
Machine Learning scripts for my Senior Capstone

This repository will contain all of the object detection scripts that I write to use the object detection models I train. Currently I am using modified detection code
that was written by Edje Electronics. I used this collab notebook to train my model: https://colab.research.google.com/github/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi/blob/master/Train_TFLite2_Object_Detction_Model.ipynb#scrollTo=TI9iCCxoNlAL
Everything that you need to train and test a custom model is in this video. I might experiment by building my own CNN using keras and tensorflow but this depends on the time that I have.
